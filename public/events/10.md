## DELAYED HA MARINES ARRIVE IN PERAX, JOIN GROWING FLEET LED BY HAS \"VALIANT\"
#### Source: The Survey Survey

The stalled out ships of the HA 613th Legionary Marines were repaired today, thanks to logistical efforts from the HAS \"VALIANT\" stationed in the outskirts of the Perax system. The marines have now joined with the growing HA fleet, alongside vast reserves of supplies that experts estimate will allow the fleet to maintain independent operations for several years.
