### ALRIGHT LISTEN UP

Noah's missing a little bit of the big picture here. Yes he's *PARTIALLY* correct that the conflict on Perax has been static at first glance. But NOAH's missing the minute changes both forces have been taking which is no surprise from someone used to just managing traffic lights. HC & TT have been **EXTENSIVELY** analyzing each other's responses to every shell, missile, and bullet fired. The Bleeding Valley has been a REAL GOOD source of evidence for this. But you guys probably already figured that, you don't wage war without wargaming first. So what's it all mean? That this war is going to get dead-locked real fast. Both sides have been doing a good job at hiding the total capabilities of their standard forces, but you can’t hide all your tanks (Okay well someone like the Armory can but these guys are nowhere near that level). From what I can gather from the composition of both side’s standard forces (data which NOAH would personally like to thank ATHENA for, if she was still with us) are FAR from ready. REAL FAR. They haven’t been testing each other’s defenses, they flat out can’t find openings. To put it in simple terms, as it stands, when it comes to strengths and weaknesses HC and TT fit each other like puzzle pieces. Meaning that unless Silverton or even BrightStar directly involve themselves, or if one of the Big Four lends one side some of their processing power (VERY, VERY UNLIKELY BUT YOU NEVER KNOW), neither side will have a decisive advantage. And yes, this includes taking into account small 3rd parties like us, despite what SISYPHUS says.  

“Okay, great, what’s this mean for us?” you probably ask. FANTASTIC I’M GLAD YOU ASKED. Expect more spillover (READ: COLLATERAL DAMAGE) as each side authorizes more and more expansive strikes. Expect harder lines to get drawn between Hong-Coleman/TiTech and Silverton/BrightStar. Most importantly, expect EXTREMELY DANGEROUS contracts to start coming in. As both sides try to find the blindspot in the other’s strategy, they’ll start breaking away from what their models tell them. And they are not going to risk any of their people on such gambits. No, what poor, expendable saps are better suited for that then mercenaries like us?  

I am **SO PSYCHED.**
