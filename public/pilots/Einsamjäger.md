"All clear on your end?"

"Yeah, all these Silverton fucks are dead. If this is what they call "the best of the best" maybe they should just consider merc help all the time, heh."

"Oh don't get full of yourself, you know this was just the rookie squad they sent out because this was just a routine transport escort."

"Yeah, I know, but they were hardly a damn challenge. Can't complain too much about the payday we're gonna get though. 'specially for a simple assassination mission."

"What are you talking about?"

"Well, we killed 'em all, didn't we?"

"Except the actual target."

"What, that Katherine chick?"

"Codename "Einsamjãger", yes."

"That dumb bitch who had her mech malfunction and now she's ended up who the fuck knows where? I ain't sticking around for her to resurface, we're calling her dead. If anyone asks, just say that one was her. Shit's too blown up to recognize anyway. Not that our client's gonna check that shit anyway."

"You know the boss won't like this."

"Yeah, well if the boss wants things done his way, he can actually bother to get his ass down here once in a while to lead a damn mission. I'm the boss right now, and I say mission complete, so we're heading back. You got it?"

"Yes, yes, I understand. Still, I can't help but be worried about all this."

"You're worried about everything."

"I prefer cautious, thank you, but this mission definitely feels... off."

"Whadya mean, people want nobles dead all the time. Been happenin' forever. You worried about them withholdin' their name? Cause--"

"No, that's standard so no one can trace it back to you. What concerns me is how this client seemed to know not only where our target and her squad would be, but also what her fighting style would be. We even jokingly asked what her favorite movie was, and they gave us an answer with no hesitation. Our client is very familiar with the target, and this makes me... strangely worried."

"And I'M worried that you're thinking too much again. We're getting out of here and getting you a drink."

"Right, right."
