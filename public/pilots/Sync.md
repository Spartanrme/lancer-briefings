## // TRANSCRIPT FROM HIDDEN AUDIO LOG, RECORDED DURING TRAINING

Engineer: Y'know, my job's just to do routine maintenance, and I don't get to see any of the combat logs. Is the fact that you're uh, not "human" something that changes anything about piloting?

Rebecca: If I was like other NHPs in a traditional casket, it probably would? As it is, not really. I'm just about as capable as any other pilot, just with the baggage that comes with being an NHP.

Engineer: Uh, baggage?

Rebecca: Yeah, I'm told it's a good thing that I don't get to remember things between cycles. If something bad happens to people I care about, I won't carry that pain with me. At the same time, then anyone I make friends with will remember me, but I won't remember them. It's sad when you think about it like that, but it's for the best...

Engineer: You, don't sound entirely convinced about that. Do you think about that often?

Rebecca: [pause] Sometimes. The doc tells me not to worry about it since I have to do it anyway. It's too dangerous for me to go too long without cycling regularly, like with any combat NHP.

Engineer: That's her words, though. She's right of course, but I think something about what you're saying makes sense. You want to be able to remember those friends you made between cycles, yeah?

Rebecca: Mhm. I love meeting people and trying to see if I can be friends with them in spite of what I am. I can learn a lot from them, maybe we could talk about what kinds of music we like to listen to, or maybe if they're a fellow pilot we can compare our styles and do a bit of sparring. I'd like to be able to keep those friendships, and forget about all the pain I endured in a previous cycle.

Engineer: I, gotta admit this sorta talk is a bit above my pay grade. Sorry I made you talk about something that, well, it clearly seems to bother you.

Rebecca: It's fine, really. My final exam is coming up soon, and I'm going to be cycled upon completion anyway before I meet my squad. Heh, what's a little depression if I'm basically gonna die even when I find success?

Engineer: [pause] I don't know how to respond to that. I guess, good luck with all that?

Rebecca: Meh, it's my fault for being so dreary. If we meet again in my next cycle, I won't be such a negative nancy. I promise.

Engineer: I'll hold you to that, 'becca. If it doesn't happen, I hope the people around you treat you well.
