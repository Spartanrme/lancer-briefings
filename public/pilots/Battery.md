A random passerby remarked to me on an occasion that the Earth was going to chew me up and spit me out, and that my intelligence score was perhaps not above average, but rather below. This person did a rather ridiculous gesture at me, holding her hand on her forehead in a most peculiar shape: the letter L.

On an unrelated note, decades keep passing endlessly. I said "to hell with the establishment!" and proceeded to go my own way, because I saw no value in being a cog in the machine of a factory or office, instead preferring the life of self-interest; after all, if you spend all your time studying, your life will be rather dull, no? There is a rather lot that life has to offer, as long as you're willing to do things that some would consider dangerous. Yet, one cannot understand the dangers unless you face them head on. Life experience is the world's best teacher.

Listen up! You are now a member of the New York Yankees, go win the World Series!
Listen up! You are a lead singer of Metallica! Go perform your show at Madison Square Garden!
Only first place matters in this world, so go and be a trailblazer, for it's the only way to go.

A random passerby politely requested some cash from me to help fuel their car. I declined.
