## OPERATION "KINGDOM'S KEYS" 

Defend Mercury One as it stabilizes into a new status quo. Silverton Families forces will likely attempt different operations to attempt to restore direct control over the station administration; they must be prevented from doing so.

The Voidstorm Mercenary Company is being directly contacted for this contract. Your encounter with the Mautinos provided the basis for a narrative to push towards Mercury One's push for greater independence, so your presence will go a long way towards legitimizing this.

Furthermore, your existing records and debts with Mercury One and the Mautino family will be wiped clean.
