# Mission // #005 
## OPERATION "BOILING SHIFT" 

Destroy the artillery position being established by Hong-Coleman in the mountains to the southwest of Walford. Intelligence suggests a high-ranking officer will be present on-site; eliminating them would further disrupt HC operations. TiTech is also providing a drone carrier they'd like escorted to the site, so that they can establish a presence after the artillery is cleared out.
