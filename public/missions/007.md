## OPERATION "PILGRIM'S PATH" 

In an effort to advertise and market their premium catalog services being established on Mercury One, SSC would like to distribute assets to their surface-side representatives. These assets include a suite of schedule 2 printers for producing preview and rentable models for prospective consumers. However some colonies, particularly Titanics Technologies, are not especially welcoming. While shipping the equipment through TiTech territory should normally be a safe and secure affair, SSC has reason to suspect that TiTech patrols may become coincidentally "rerouted" or "unavailable," leaving a window of opportunity for local hostiles to interrupt transit. With the Perax Foreign Affairs Accords limiting SSC's official surface-side presence, they are requesting a mercenary group to provide escort.
